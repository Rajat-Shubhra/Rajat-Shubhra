🔭 I’m currently working on  Competitive Programming <br>💬 Ask me about my life <br>🌱 I’m currently learning Dynamic programming <br>⚡ Fun fact: The world's first computer bug wasn't actually a bug, but a moth! In 1945, Grace Hopper, a pioneer in computer science, found a malfunction in a Mark II computer caused by a moth stuck in a relay. She dubbed it a "bug", and the term stuck, forever connecting tiny glitches with creepy crawlies.
